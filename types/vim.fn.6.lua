--
-- 		{callback} is the function to call.  It can be the name of a

-- Return a |List|, which is the stack of syntax items at the

-- 		The first item in the List is the outer region, following are
-- 		items contained in that one.  The last one is what |synID()|
-- 		returns, unless not the whole item is highlighted or it is a
-- 		transparent item.
-- 		This function is useful for debugging a syntax file.
-- 		Example that shows the syntax stack under the cursor: >
-- 			for id in synstack(line("."), col("."))
-- 			   echo synIDattr(id, "name")
-- 			endfor
-- <		When the position specified with {lnum} and {col} is invalid
-- 		nothing is returned.  The position just after the last

-- 		valid positions.
--- @return list

-- The result is a Number, which is the screen column of the file
-- 		position given with {expr}.  That is, the last screen position
-- 		occupied by the character at that position, when the screen
-- 		would be of unlimited width.  When there is a <Tab> at the
-- 		position, the returned Number will be the column at the end of
-- 		the <Tab>.  For example, for a <Tab> in column 1, with 'ts'
-- 		set to 8, it returns 8. |conceal| is ignored.
-- 		For the byte position use |col()|.
-- 		For the use of {expr} see |col()|.
-- 		When 'virtualedit' is used {expr} can be [lnum, col, off], where
-- 		"off" is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.  When "off" is omitted zero is used.
-- 		When Virtual editing is active in the current mode, a position
-- 		beyond the end of the line can be returned. |'virtualedit'|
-- 		The accepted positions are:
-- 		    .	    the cursor position
-- 		    $	    the end of the cursor line (the result is the
-- 			    number of displayed characters in the cursor line
-- 			    plus one)
-- 		    'x	    position of mark x (if the mark is not set, 0 is
-- 			    returned)
-- 		    v       In Visual mode: the start of the Visual area (the
-- 			    cursor is the end).  When not in Visual mode
-- 			    returns the cursor position.  Differs from |'<| in
-- 			    that it's updated right away.
-- 		Note that only marks in the current file can be used.
-- 		Examples: >
--   virtcol(".")	   with text "foo^Lbar", with cursor on the "^L", returns 5
--   virtcol("$")	   with text "foo^Lbar", returns 9
--   virtcol("'t")    with text "	  there", with 't at 'h', returns 6
-- <		The first column is 1.  0 is returned for an error.

-- 		On Windows the ".exe", ".bat", etc. can

-- 		tried.  Thus if "foo.exe" does not exist, "foo.exe.bat" can be
-- 		found.  If $PATHEXT is not set then ".exe;.com;.bat;.cmd" is
-- 		used.  A dot by itself can be used in $PATHEXT to try using
-- 		the name without an extension.  When 'shell' looks like a
-- 		Unix shell, then the name is also tried without adding an
-- 		extension.
-- 		On Windows it only checks if the file exists and
-- 		is not a directory, not if it's really executable.
-- 		On Windows an executable in the same directory as Vim is
-- 		always found (it is added to $PATH at |startup|).

-- Call function {funcname} in the run-time library {libname}

-- 		This is useful to call functions in a library that you
-- 		especially made to be used with Vim.  Since only one argument
-- 		is possible, calling standard library functions is rather
-- 		limited.
-- 		The result is the String returned by the function.  If the
-- 		function returns NULL, this will appear as an empty string ""
-- 		to Vim.
-- 		If the function returns a number, use libcallnr()!
-- 		If {argument} is a number, it is passed to the function as an
-- 		int; if {argument} is a string, it is passed as a
-- 		null-terminated string.
-- 		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.
--
-- 		libcall() allows you to write your own 'plug-in' extensions to
-- 		Vim without having to recompile the program.  It is NOT a
-- 		means to call system functions!  If you try to do so Vim will
-- 		very probably crash.
--
-- 		For Win32, the functions you write must be placed in a DLL
-- 		and use the normal C calling convention (NOT Pascal which is
-- 		used in Windows System DLLs).  The function must take exactly
-- 		one parameter, either a character pointer or a long integer,
-- 		and must return a character pointer or NULL.  The character
-- 		pointer returned must point to memory that will remain valid
-- 		after the function has returned (e.g. in static data in the
-- 		DLL).  If it points to allocated memory, that memory will
-- 		leak away.  Using a static buffer in the function should work,
-- 		it's then freed when the DLL is unloaded.
--
-- 		WARNING: If the function returns a non-valid pointer, Vim may
-- 		crash!	This also happens if the function returns a number,
-- 		because Vim thinks it's a pointer.
-- 		For Win32 systems, {libname} should be the filename of the DLL
-- 		without the ".DLL" suffix.  A full path is only required if
-- 		the DLL is not in the usual places.
-- 		For Unix: When compiling your own plugins, remember that the
-- 		object code must be compiled as position-independent ('PIC').

-- 		'c'	accept a match at the Cursor position
-- 		'e'	move to the End of the match
-- 		'n'	do Not move the cursor
-- 		'p'	return number of matching sub-Pattern (see below)
-- 		's'	Set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
-- 		'w'	Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'W'	don't Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'z'	start searching at the cursor column instead of Zero
-- 		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.
--
-- 		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
-- 		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
-- 		flag.
--
-- 		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.
--
-- 		When the 'z' flag is not given, searching always starts in
-- 		column zero and then matches before the cursor are skipped.
-- 		When the 'c' flag is present in 'cpo' the next search starts
-- 		after the match.  Without the 'c' flag the next search starts
-- 		one column further.
--
-- 		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
-- 		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
-- 		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
-- 			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
-- 			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
-- <		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
-- 		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
-- 		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.
--
-- 		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
-- 		more than this many milliseconds have passed.  Thus when
-- 		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
-- 		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
-- 		giving the argument.
--
-- 							*search()-sub-match*
-- 		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
-- 		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
-- 		whole pattern did match.
-- 		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.
--
-- 		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
-- 		flag is used.
--
-- 		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
-- 		    :let n = 1
-- 		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
-- 		    :  exe "argument " . n
-- 		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the

-- 		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
-- 		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
-- 		    :	 let flags = "W"
-- 		    :  endwhile
-- 		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
-- 		    :  let n = n + 1
-- 		    :endwhile
-- <
-- 		Example for using some flags: >
-- 		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
-- <		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
-- 		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
-- 		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
-- 		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
-- 		line:
-- 		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
-- 		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
-- 		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
-- 		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
-- 		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.

-- 					done by comparing with an empty
-- 					string)
-- 			*funcname	built-in function (see |functions|)
-- 					or user defined function (see
-- 					|user-function|). Also works for a
-- 					variable that is a Funcref.
-- 			varname		internal variable (see
-- 					|internal-variables|).  Also works
-- 					for |curly-braces-names|, |Dictionary|
-- 					entries, |List| items, etc.  Beware
-- 					that evaluating an index may cause an
-- 					error message for an invalid
-- 					expression.  E.g.: >
-- 					   :let l = [1, 2, 3]
-- 					   :echo exists("l[5]")
-- <					   0 >
-- 					   :echo exists("l[xx]")
-- <					   E121: Undefined variable: xx
-- 					   0
-- 			:cmdname	Ex command: built-in command, user
-- 					command or command modifier |:command|.
-- 					Returns:
-- 					1  for match with start of a command
-- 					2  full match with a command
-- 					3  matches several user commands
-- 					To check for a supported command
-- 					always check the return value to be 2.
-- 			:2match		The |:2match| command.
-- 			:3match		The |:3match| command.
-- 			#event		autocommand defined for this event
-- 			#event#pattern	autocommand defined for this event and
-- 					pattern (the pattern is taken
-- 					literally and compared to the
-- 					autocommand patterns character by
-- 					character)
-- 			#group		autocommand group exists
-- 			#group#event	autocommand defined for this group and
-- 					event.
-- 			#group#event#pattern
-- 					autocommand defined for this group,
-- 					event and pattern.
-- 			##event		autocommand for this event is
-- 					supported.

-- 		Also see |sub-replace-expression|.
--
-- 		If {list} is present and non-zero then submatch() returns
-- 		a list of strings, similar to |getline()| with two arguments.
-- 		NL characters in the text represent NUL characters in the

-- 		Only returns more than one item for |:substitute|, inside
-- 		|substitute()| this list will always contain one or zero
-- 		items, since there are no real line breaks.
--
-- 		When substitute() is used recursively only the submatches in
-- 		the current (deepest) call can be obtained.
--
-- 		Examples: >

-- 			:echo substitute(text, '\d\+', '\=submatch(0) + 1', '')
-- <		This finds the first number in the line and adds one to it.

-- Play a sound identified by {name}.  Which event names are

-- 			call sound_playevent('bell')
-- <		On MS-Windows, {name} can be SystemAsterisk, SystemDefault,
-- 		SystemExclamation, SystemExit, SystemHand, SystemQuestion,
-- 		SystemStart, SystemWelcome, etc.
--
-- 		When {callback} is specified it is invoked when the sound is
-- 		finished.  The first argument is the sound ID, the second
-- 		argument is the status:
-- 			0	sound was played to the end
-- 			1	sound was interrupted
-- 			2	error occurred after sound started
-- 		Example: >

-- Convert String {expr} to a Float.  This mostly works the same
-- 		as when using a floating point number in an expression, see
-- 		|floating-point-format|.  But it's a bit more permissive.
-- 		E.g., "1e40" is accepted, while in an expression you need to
-- 		write "1.0e40".  The hexadecimal form "0x123" is also
-- 		accepted, but not others, like binary or octal.
-- 		Text after the number is silently ignored.
-- 		The decimal point is always '.', no matter what the locale is
-- 		set to.  A comma ends the number: "12,345.67" is converted to
-- 		12.0.  You can strip out thousands separators with
-- 		|substitute()|: >
-- 			let f = str2float(substitute(text, ',', '', 'g'))
--- @return float

-- 		use of special characters.
--
-- 		Unless the optional {nosuf} argument is given and is |TRUE|,

-- 		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
-- 		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
-- 		'wildignorecase' always applies.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is,
-- 		you also get filenames containing newlines correctly.
-- 		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
-- 		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.
--
-- 		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty String or List.
--
-- 		You can also use |readdir()| if you need to do complicated
-- 		things, such as limiting the number of matches.
--
-- 		A name for a non-existing file is not included.  A symbolic
-- 		link is only included if it points to an existing file.
-- 		However, when the {alllinks} argument is present and it is
-- 		|TRUE| then all symbolic links are included.
--
-- 		For most systems backticks can be used to get files names from
-- 		any external command.  Example: >
-- 			:let tagfiles = glob("`find . -name tags -print`")
-- 			:let &tags = substitute(tagfiles, "\n", ",", "g")
-- <		The result of the program inside the backticks should be one
-- 		item per line.  Spaces inside an item are allowed.
--

--
-- 		{prot} is applied for all parts of {name}.  Thus if you create

-- Remove a previously placed sign in one or more buffers.  This
-- 		is similar to the |:sign-unplace| command.
--
-- 		{group} is the sign group name. To use the global sign group,
-- 		use an empty string.  If {group} is set to '*', then all the
-- 		groups including the global group are used.
-- 		The signs in {group} are selected based on the entries in
-- 		{dict}.  The following optional entries in {dict} are
-- 		supported:
-- 			buffer	buffer name or number. See |bufname()|.
-- 			id	sign identifier
-- 		If {dict} is not supplied, then all the signs in {group} are
-- 		removed.
--
-- 		Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			" Remove sign 10 from buffer a.vim
-- 			call sign_unplace('', {'buffer' : "a.vim", 'id' : 10})
--
-- 			" Remove sign 20 in group 'g1' from buffer 3
-- 			call sign_unplace('g1', {'buffer' : 3, 'id' : 20})
--
-- 			" Remove all the signs in group 'g2' from buffer 10
-- 			call sign_unplace('g2', {'buffer' : 10})
--
-- 			" Remove sign 30 in group 'g3' from all the buffers
-- 			call sign_unplace('g3', {'id' : 30})
--
-- 			" Remove all the signs placed in buffer 5
-- 			call sign_unplace('*', {'buffer' : 5})
--
-- 			" Remove the signs in group 'g4' from all the buffers
-- 			call sign_unplace('g4')
--
-- 			" Remove sign 40 from all the buffers
-- 			call sign_unplace('*', {'id' : 40})
--
-- 			" Remove all the placed signs from all the buffers
-- 			call sign_unplace('*')

-- Waits for jobs and their |on_exit| handlers to complete.
--
-- 		{jobs} is a List of |job-id|s to wait for.
-- 		{timeout} is the maximum waiting time in milliseconds, -1
-- 		means forever.
--
-- 		Timeout of 0 can be used to check the status of a job: >
-- 			let running = jobwait([{job-id}], 0)[0] == -1
-- <
-- 		During jobwait() callbacks for jobs not in the {jobs} list may
-- 		be invoked. The screen will not redraw unless |:redraw| is
-- 		invoked by a callback.
--
-- 		Returns a list of len({jobs}) integers, where each integer is
-- 		the status of the corresponding job:
-- 			Exit-code, if the job exited
-- 			-1 if the timeout was exceeded
-- 			-2 if the job was interrupted (by |CTRL-C|)
-- 			-3 if the job-id is invalid

-- The result is a Dict with the screen position of the text
-- 		character in window {winid} at buffer line {lnum} and column

-- 		The Dict has these members:
-- 			row	screen row
-- 			col	first screen column
-- 			endcol	last screen column
-- 			curscol	cursor screen column
-- 		If the specified position is not visible, all values are zero.
-- 		The "endcol" value differs from "col" when the character
-- 		occupies more than one screen cell.  E.g. for a Tab "col" can
-- 		be 1 and "endcol" can be 8.
-- 		The "curscol" value is where the cursor would be placed.  For
-- 		a Tab it would be the same as "endcol", while for a double
-- 		width character it would be the same as "col".

-- 			:echo sin(-4.01)
-- <			0.763301
--- @return float

-- 		    :	normal Ex command
-- 		    >	debug mode command |debug-mode|
-- 		    /	forward search command

-- 		    @	|input()| command
-- 		    -	|:insert| or |:append| command
-- 		    =	|i_CTRL-R_=|
-- 		Only works when editing the command line, thus requires use of
-- 		|c_CTRL-\_e| or |c_CTRL-R_=| or an expression mapping.
-- 		Returns an empty string otherwise.
-- 		Also see |getcmdpos()|, |setcmdpos()| and |getcmdline()|.

-- Set option or local variable {varname} in window {winnr} to

-- 		Tabs are numbered starting with one.  For the current tabpage
-- 		use |setwinvar()|.
-- 		{winnr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.
-- 		When {winnr} is zero the current window is used.
-- 		This also works for a global or local buffer option, but it
-- 		doesn't work for a global or local buffer variable.
-- 		For a local buffer option the global value is unchanged.
-- 		Note that the variable name without "w:" must be used.

-- Restores a list of matches saved by |getmatches() for the

-- 			nr2char(64)		returns "@"
-- 			nr2char(32)		returns " "
-- <		Example for "utf-8": >
-- 			nr2char(300)		returns I with bow character
-- <		UTF-8 encoding is always used, {utf8} option has no effect,
-- 		and exists only for backwards-compatibility.
-- 		Note that a NUL character in the file is specified with
-- 		nr2char(10), because NULs are represented with newline
-- 		characters.  nr2char(0) is a real NUL and terminates the
-- 		string, thus results in an empty string.

-- nvim_...({...})					*E5555* *nvim_...()* *eval-api*

-- 		be stricter than for most other builtins. For instance,
-- 		if Integer is expected, a |Number| must be passed in, a
-- 		|String| will not be autoconverted.
-- 		Buffer numbers, as returned by |bufnr()| could be used as
-- 		first argument to nvim_buf_... functions.  All functions
-- 		expecting an object (buffer, window or tabpage) can
-- 		also take the numerical value 0 to indicate the current
-- 		(focused) object.

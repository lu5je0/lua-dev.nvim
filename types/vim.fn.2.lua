-- The result is a Number, which is the current screen column of
-- 		the cursor. The leftmost column has number 1.
-- 		This function is mainly used for testing.
--
-- 		Note: Always returns the current screen column, thus if used
-- 		in a command (e.g. ":echo screencol()") it will return the
-- 		column inside the command line, which is 1 when the command is
-- 		executed. To get the cursor position in the file use one of
-- 		the following mappings: >
-- 			nnoremap <expr> GG ":echom ".screencol()."\n"
-- 			nnoremap <silent> GG :echom screencol()<CR>
-- 			noremap GG <Cmd>echom screencol()<Cr>
--- @return number

-- The result is a Number, which is the current screen row of the

-- 		Alternatively you can use |winline()|.
--
-- 		Note: Same restrictions as with |screencol()|.
--- @return number

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they
-- 		come from a mapping or were typed by the user.
--
-- 		By default the string is added to the end of the typeahead
-- 		buffer, thus if a mapping is still being executed the
-- 		characters come after them.  Use the 'i' flag to insert before
-- 		other characters, they will be executed next, before any
-- 		characters from a mapping.
--
-- 		The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in
-- 		{string}.
--
-- 		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes
-- 		and "\..." notation |expr-quote|. For example,
-- 		feedkeys("\<CR>") simulates pressing of the <Enter> key. But
-- 		feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
-- 		The |<Ignore>| keycode may be used to exit the
-- 		wait-for-character without doing anything.
--
-- 		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.  If {mode} is absent,
-- 			keys are remapped.
-- 		'n'	Do not remap keys.
-- 		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
-- 			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
-- 			opening folds, etc.
-- 		'i'	Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
-- 		'x'	Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
-- 			similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
-- 			several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
-- 			(possibly with an empty {string}) to execute all the
-- 			typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
-- 			will behave as if <Esc> is typed, to avoid getting
-- 			stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
-- 			script continues.
-- 			Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
-- 			executing commands, thus calling it recursively, the
-- 			all typehead will be consumed by the last call.
-- 		'!'	When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be
-- 			used in a test when a timer is set to exit Insert mode
-- 			a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.
--
-- 		Return value is always 0.
--- @return number

-- 			nr2char(300)		returns I with bow character
-- <		UTF-8 encoding is always used, {utf8} option has no effect,
-- 		and exists only for backwards-compatibility.
-- 		Note that a NUL character in the file is specified with
-- 		nr2char(10), because NULs are represented with newline
-- 		characters.  nr2char(0) is a real NUL and terminates the
-- 		string, thus results in an empty string.
--
-- nvim_...({...})					*E5555* *nvim_...()* *eval-api*
-- 		Call nvim |api| functions. The type checking of arguments will
-- 		be stricter than for most other builtins. For instance,
-- 		if Integer is expected, a |Number| must be passed in, a
-- 		|String| will not be autoconverted.
-- 		Buffer numbers, as returned by |bufnr()| could be used as
-- 		first argument to nvim_buf_... functions.  All functions
-- 		expecting an object (buffer, window or tabpage) can
-- 		also take the numerical value 0 to indicate the current
-- 		(focused) object.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.nr2char(expr, utf8) end

-- Get a single character from the user or input stream.
-- 		If [expr] is omitted, wait until a character is available.
-- 		If [expr] is 0, only get a character when one is available.
-- 			Return zero otherwise.
-- 		If [expr] is 1, only check if a character is available, it is
-- 			not consumed.  Return zero if no character available.
--
-- 		Without [expr] and when [expr] is 0 a whole character or
-- 		special key is returned.  If it is a single character, the
-- 		result is a number.  Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
-- 		Otherwise a String is returned with the encoded character.
-- 		For a special key it's a String with a sequence of bytes
-- 		starting with 0x80 (decimal: 128).  This is the same value as
-- 		the String "\<Key>", e.g., "\<Left>".  The returned value is
-- 		also a String when a modifier (shift, control, alt) was used
-- 		that is not included in the character.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay
-- 		while Vim waits to see if this is the start of an escape
-- 		sequence.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 1 only the first byte is returned.  For a
-- 		one-byte character it is the character itself as a number.
-- 		Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
--
-- 		Use getcharmod() to obtain any additional modifiers.
--
-- 		When the user clicks a mouse button, the mouse event will be
-- 		returned.  The position can then be found in |v:mouse_col|,
-- 		|v:mouse_lnum|, |v:mouse_winid| and |v:mouse_win|.  This
-- 		example positions the mouse as it would normally happen: >
-- 			let c = getchar()
-- 			if c == "\<LeftMouse>" && v:mouse_win > 0
-- 			  exe v:mouse_win . "wincmd w"
-- 			  exe v:mouse_lnum
-- 			  exe "normal " . v:mouse_col . "|"
-- 			endif
-- <
-- 		There is no prompt, you will somehow have to make clear to the
-- 		user that a character has to be typed.
-- 		There is no mapping for the character.
-- 		Key codes are replaced, thus when the user presses the <Del>
-- 		key you get the code for the <Del> key, not the raw character
-- 		sequence.  Examples: >
-- 			getchar() == "\<Del>"
-- 			getchar() == "\<S-Left>"
-- <		This example redefines "f" to ignore case: >
-- 			:nmap f :call FindChar()<CR>
-- 			:function FindChar()

-- 		One of "running" or "finished" is always present.
--
-- 		{buf} must be the buffer number of a terminal window. If the

-- Search for regexp pattern {pattern}.  The search starts at the
-- 		cursor position (you can use |cursor()| to set it).
--
-- 		When a match has been found its line number is returned.
-- 		If there is no match a 0 is returned and the cursor doesn't
-- 		move.  No error message is given.
--
-- 		{flags} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'b'	search Backward instead of forward
-- 		'c'	accept a match at the Cursor position
-- 		'e'	move to the End of the match
-- 		'n'	do Not move the cursor
-- 		'p'	return number of matching sub-Pattern (see below)
-- 		's'	Set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
-- 		'w'	Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'W'	don't Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'z'	start searching at the cursor column instead of Zero
-- 		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.
--
-- 		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
-- 		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
-- 		flag.
--
-- 		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.
--
-- 		When the 'z' flag is not given, searching always starts in
-- 		column zero and then matches before the cursor are skipped.
-- 		When the 'c' flag is present in 'cpo' the next search starts
-- 		after the match.  Without the 'c' flag the next search starts
-- 		one column further.
--
-- 		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
-- 		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
-- 		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
-- 			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
-- 			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
-- <		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
-- 		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
-- 		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.
--
-- 		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
-- 		more than this many milliseconds have passed.  Thus when
-- 		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
-- 		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
-- 		giving the argument.
--
-- 							*search()-sub-match*
-- 		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
-- 		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
-- 		whole pattern did match.
-- 		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.
--
-- 		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
-- 		flag is used.
--
-- 		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
-- 		    :let n = 1
-- 		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
-- 		    :  exe "argument " . n
-- 		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the
-- 		    :  " first search to find match at start of file
-- 		    :  normal G$
-- 		    :  let flags = "w"
-- 		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
-- 		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
-- 		    :	 let flags = "W"
-- 		    :  endwhile
-- 		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
-- 		    :  let n = n + 1
-- 		    :endwhile
-- <
-- 		Example for using some flags: >
-- 		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
-- <		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
-- 		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
-- 		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
-- 		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
-- 		line:
-- 		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
-- 		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
-- 		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
-- 		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
-- 		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.search(pattern, flags, stopline, timeout) end

-- Return a list with the buffer numbers of all buffers for
-- 		terminal windows.
--- @return list
function vim.fn.term_list() end

-- Get the contents of {row} of terminal screen of {buf}.
-- 		For {buf} see |term_getsize()|.
--
-- 		The first line has {row} one.  When {row} is "." the cursor
-- 		line is used.  When {row} is invalid an empty string is
-- 		returned.
--
-- 		Return a List containing a Dict for each screen cell:
-- 		    "chars"	character(s) at the cell
-- 		    "fg"	foreground color as #rrggbb
-- 		    "bg"	background color as #rrggbb
-- 		    "attr"	attributes of the cell, use |term_getattr()|
-- 				to get the individual flags

--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >

-- Send keystrokes {keys} to terminal {buf}.
-- 		{buf} is used as with |term_getsize()|.
--
-- 		{keys} are translated as key sequences. For example, "\<c-x>"

-- Set the ANSI color palette used by terminal {buf}.
-- 		{colors} must be a List of 16 valid color names or hexadecimal
-- 		color codes, like those accepted by |highlight-guifg|.
-- 		Also see |term_getansicolors()| and |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.
--
-- 		The colors normally are:
-- 			0    black
-- 			1    dark red
-- 			2    dark green
-- 			3    brown
-- 			4    dark blue
-- 			5    dark magenta

-- 			11   yellow
-- 			12   blue
-- 			13   magenta
-- 			14   cyan
-- 			15   white
--
-- 		These colors are used in the GUI and in the terminal when
-- 		'termguicolors' is set.  When not using GUI colors (GUI mode
-- 		or 'termguicolors'), the terminal window always uses the 16
-- 		ANSI colors of the underlying terminal.

-- When exiting Vim or trying to close the terminal window in

-- 		command like gdb.
--
-- 		Returns the buffer number of the terminal window.  If {cmd}
-- 		cannot be executed the window does open and shows an error
-- 		message.
-- 		If opening the window fails zero is returned.
--
-- 		{options} are similar to what is used for |job_start()|, see

--
-- 		There are extra options:
-- 		   "term_name"	     name to use for the buffer name, instead

-- 		   "term_finish"     What to do when the job is finished:
-- 					"close": close any windows
-- 					"open": open window if needed
-- 				     Note that "open" can be interruptive.
-- 				     See |term++close| and |term++open|.
-- 		   "term_opencmd"    command to use for opening the window when
-- 				     "open" is used for "term_finish"; must
-- 				     have "%d" where the buffer number goes,
-- 				     e.g. "10split|buffer %d"; when not

-- 		   "eof_chars"	     Text to send after all buffer lines were
-- 				     written to the terminal.  When not set
-- 				     CTRL-D is used on MS-Windows. For Python
-- 				     use CTRL-Z or "exit()". For a shell use
-- 				     "exit".  A CR is always added.
-- 		   "ansi_colors"     A list of 16 color names or hex codes
-- 				     defining the ANSI palette used in GUI
-- 				     color modes.  See |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.

--
-- 		When the {special} argument is present and it's a non-zero

-- 		command.
--
-- 		The "!" character will be escaped (again with a |non-zero-arg|

-- 		Example: >

-- 		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it is called with two arguments:
-- 			1. The key or the index of the current item.

-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {key -> 'item: ' . key})
-- <		If you do not use "key" you can use a short name: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {_, val -> 'item: ' . val})

-- 			let mpack = readfile(fname, 'b')
-- 			let shada_objects = msgpackparse(mpack)
-- <		This will read ~/.config/nvim/shada/main.shada file to
-- 		`shada_objects` list.
--
-- 		Limitations:
-- 		1. Mapping ordering is not preserved unless messagepack
-- 		   mapping is dumped using generic  mapping
-- 		   (|msgpack-special-map|).
-- 		2. Since the parser aims to preserve all data untouched
-- 		   (except for 1.) some strings are parsed to
-- 		   |msgpack-special-dict| format which is not convenient to
-- 		   use.
-- 							*msgpack-special-dict*
-- 		Some messagepack strings may be parsed to special
-- 		dictionaries. Special dictionaries are dictionaries which
--
-- 		1. Contain exactly two keys: `_TYPE` and `_VAL`.
-- 		2. `_TYPE` key is one of the types found in |v:msgpack_types|
-- 		   variable.
-- 		3. Value for `_VAL` has the following format (Key column
-- 		   contains name of the key from |v:msgpack_types|):
--
-- 		Key	Value ~
-- 		nil	Zero, ignored when dumping.  Not returned by
-- 			|msgpackparse()| since |v:null| was introduced.
-- 		boolean	One or zero.  When dumping it is only checked that
-- 			value is a |Number|.  Not returned by |msgpackparse()|
-- 			since |v:true| and |v:false| were introduced.
-- 		integer	|List| with four numbers: sign (-1 or 1), highest two
-- 			bits, number with bits from 62nd to 31st, lowest 31
-- 			bits. I.e. to get actual number one will need to use
-- 			code like >
-- 				_VAL[0] * ((_VAL[1] << 62)
-- 				           & (_VAL[2] << 31)
-- 				           & _VAL[3])
-- <			Special dictionary with this type will appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output under one of the following
-- 			circumstances:
-- 			1. |Number| is 32-bit and value is either above
-- 			   INT32_MAX or below INT32_MIN.
-- 			2. |Number| is 64-bit and value is above INT64_MAX. It
-- 			   cannot possibly be below INT64_MIN because msgpack
-- 			   C parser does not support such values.
-- 		float	|Float|. This value cannot possibly appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output.
-- 		string	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if string contains
-- 			zero byte or if string is a mapping key and mapping is
-- 			being represented as special dictionary for other
-- 			reasons.
-- 		binary	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if binary string
-- 			contains zero byte.
-- 		array	|List|. This value cannot appear in |msgpackparse()|
-- 			output.
-- 							*msgpack-special-map*
-- 		map	|List| of |List|s with two items (key and value) each.
-- 			This value will appear in |msgpackparse()| output if
-- 			parsed mapping contains one of the following keys:
-- 			1. Any key that is not a string (including keys which
-- 			   are binary strings).
-- 			2. String with NUL byte inside.
-- 			3. Duplicate key.
-- 			4. Empty key.
-- 		ext	|List| with two values: first is a signed integer
-- 			representing extension type. Second is
-- 			|readfile()|-style list of strings.
--- @param list any[]
--- @return list
function vim.fn.msgpackparse(list) end

-- Return a |String| that is null. Only useful for testing.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.test_null_string() end

-- Reset the flag that indicates option {name} was set.  Thus it
-- 		looks like it still has the default value. Use like this: >
-- 			set ambiwidth=double
-- 			call test_option_not_set('ambiwidth')
-- <		Now the 'ambiwidth' option behaves like it was never changed,
-- 		even though the value is "double".
-- 		Only to be used for testing!
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetOptionName()->test_option_not_set()
--- @return none
function vim.fn.test_option_not_set(name) end

-- Same as |match()|, but return the matched string.  Example: >
-- 			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing")
-- <		results in "ing".
-- 		When there is no match "" is returned.
-- 		The {start}, if given, has the same meaning as for |match()|. >
-- 			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing", 2)
-- <		results in "ing". >
-- 			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing", 5)
-- <		result is "".
-- 		When {expr} is a |List| then the matching item is returned.
-- 		The type isn't changed, it's not necessarily a String.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.matchstr(expr, pat, start, count) end

-- Overrides certain parts of Vim's internal processing to be able
-- 		to run tests. Only to be used for testing Vim!
-- 		The override is enabled when {val} is non-zero and removed
-- 		when {val} is zero.
-- 		Current supported values for name are:
--
-- 		name	     effect when {val} is non-zero ~
-- 		redraw       disable the redrawing() function
-- 		redraw_flag  ignore the RedrawingDisabled flag
-- 		char_avail   disable the char_avail() function
-- 		starting     reset the "starting" variable, see below
-- 		nfa_fail     makes the NFA regexp engine fail to force a
-- 			     fallback to the old engine
-- 		no_query_mouse  do not query the mouse position for "dec"
-- 				terminals
-- 		no_wait_return	set the "no_wait_return" flag.  Not restored
-- 				with "ALL".
-- 		ALL	     clear all overrides ({val} is not used)
--
-- 		"starting" is to be used when a test should behave like
-- 		startup was done.  Since the tests are run by sourcing a
-- 		script the "starting" variable is non-zero. This is usually a
-- 		good thing (tests run faster), but sometimes changes behavior
-- 		in a way that the test doesn't work properly.
-- 		When using: >
-- 			call test_override('starting', 1)
-- <		The value of "starting" is saved.  It is restored by: >
-- 			call test_override('starting', 0)
--
-- <		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetOverrideVal()-> test_override('starting')
--- @return none
function vim.fn.test_override(expr, val) end

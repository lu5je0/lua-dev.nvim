-- 		trailing backslash, remove it if you put a comma after it.
-- 		If the expansion fails for one of the directories, there is no
-- 		error message.
--
-- 		Unless the optional {nosuf} argument is given and is |TRUE|,
-- 		the 'suffixes' and 'wildignore' options apply: Names matching
-- 		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
-- 		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is, you
-- 		also get filenames containing newlines correctly. Otherwise
-- 		the result is a String and when there are several matches,
-- 		they are separated by <NL> characters.  Example: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim", 0, 1)
-- <
-- 		{allinks} is used as with |glob()|.
--
-- 		The "**" item can be used to search in a directory tree.
-- 		For example, to find all "README.txt" files in the directories
-- 		in 'runtimepath' and below: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "**/README.txt")
-- <		Upwards search and limiting the depth of "**" is not
-- 		supported, thus using 'path' will not always work properly.
--- @param list any[]
--- @return string
function vim.fn.globpath(path, expr, nosuf, list, alllinks) end

-- Return a String with {fmt}, where "%" items are replaced by
-- 		the formatted form of their respective arguments.  Example: >
-- 			printf("%4d: E%d %.30s", lnum, errno, msg)
-- <		May result in:
-- 			"  99: E42 asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfas" ~
--
-- 		Often used items are:
-- 		  %s	string
-- 		  %6S	string right-aligned in 6 display cells
-- 		  %6s	string right-aligned in 6 bytes
-- 		  %.9s	string truncated to 9 bytes
-- 		  %c	single byte
-- 		  %d	decimal number
-- 		  %5d	decimal number padded with spaces to 5 characters
-- 		  %b	binary number
-- 		  %08b	binary number padded with zeros to at least 8 characters
-- 		  %B	binary number using upper case letters
-- 		  %x	hex number
-- 		  %04x	hex number padded with zeros to at least 4 characters
-- 		  %X	hex number using upper case letters
-- 		  %o	octal number
-- 		  %f	floating point number as 12.23, inf, -inf or nan
-- 		  %F	floating point number as 12.23, INF, -INF or NAN
-- 		  %e	floating point number as 1.23e3, inf, -inf or nan
-- 		  %E	floating point number as 1.23E3, INF, -INF or NAN
-- 		  %g	floating point number, as %f or %e depending on value
-- 		  %G	floating point number, as %F or %E depending on value
-- 		  %%	the % character itself
-- 		  %p	representation of the pointer to the container
--
-- 		Conversion specifications start with '%' and end with the
-- 		conversion type.  All other characters are copied unchanged to
-- 		the result.
--
-- 		The "%" starts a conversion specification.  The following
-- 		arguments appear in sequence:
--
-- 			%  [flags]  [field-width]  [.precision]  type
--
-- 		flags
-- 			Zero or more of the following flags:
--
-- 		    #	      The value should be converted to an "alternate
-- 			      form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
-- 			      has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
-- 			      of the number is increased to force the first
-- 			      character of the output string to a zero (except
-- 			      if a zero value is printed with an explicit
-- 			      precision of zero).
-- 			      For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
-- 			      the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
-- 			      prepended to it.
--
-- 		    0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
-- 			      value is padded on the left with zeros rather
-- 			      than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
-- 			      numeric conversion (d, o, x, and X), the 0 flag
-- 			      is ignored.
--
-- 		    -	      A negative field width flag; the converted value
-- 			      is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
-- 			      The converted value is padded on the right with
-- 			      blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
-- 			      zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.
--
-- 		    ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
-- 			      number produced by a signed conversion (d).
--
-- 		    +	      A sign must always be placed before a number
-- 			      produced by a signed conversion.  A + overrides
-- 			      a space if both are used.
--
-- 		field-width
-- 			An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
-- 			field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
-- 			than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
-- 			the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
-- 			been given) to fill out the field width.
--
-- 		.precision
-- 			An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
-- 			followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
-- 			string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
-- 			This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
-- 			d, o, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
-- 			bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions.
-- 			For floating point it is the number of digits after
-- 			the decimal point.
--
-- 		type
-- 			A character that specifies the type of conversion to
-- 			be applied, see below.
--
-- 		A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
-- 		asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
-- 		Number argument supplies the field width or precision.  A
-- 		negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
-- 		followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
-- 		treated as though it were missing.  Example: >
-- 			:echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
-- <		This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
-- 		"width" bytes.
--
-- 		The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
--
-- 				*printf-d* *printf-b* *printf-B* *printf-o* *printf-x* *printf-X*
-- 		dbBoxX	The Number argument is converted to signed decimal (d),
-- 			unsigned binary (b and B), unsigned octal (o), or
-- 			unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters
-- 			"abcdef" are used for x conversions; the letters
-- 			"ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.  The precision, if
-- 			any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
-- 			appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it
-- 			is padded on the left with zeros.  In no case does a
-- 			non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
-- 			numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider
-- 			than the field width, the field is expanded to contain
-- 			the conversion result.
-- 			The 'h' modifier indicates the argument is 16 bits.
-- 			The 'l' modifier indicates the argument is 32 bits.
-- 			The 'L' modifier indicates the argument is 64 bits.
-- 			Generally, these modifiers are not useful. They are
-- 			ignored when type is known from the argument.
--
-- 		i	alias for d
-- 		D	alias for ld
-- 		U	alias for lu
-- 		O	alias for lo
--
-- 							*printf-c*
-- 		c	The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
-- 			resulting character is written.
--
-- 							*printf-s*
-- 		s	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
-- 			specified are used.
-- 			If the argument is not a String type, it is
-- 			automatically converted to text with the same format
-- 			as ":echo".
-- 							*printf-S*
-- 		S	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more display cells than the
-- 			number specified are used.
--
-- 							*printf-f* *E807*
-- 		f F	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
-- 			digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
-- 			zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
-- 			is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
-- 			(out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf"
-- 			 or "-inf" with %f (INF or -INF with %F).
-- 			 "0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan" with %f (NAN with %F).
-- 			Example: >
-- 				echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
-- <				12.12
-- 			Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
-- 			Use |round()| when in doubt.
--
-- 							*printf-e* *printf-E*
-- 		e E	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
-- 			precision specifies the number of digits after the
-- 			decimal point, like with 'f'.
--
-- 							*printf-g* *printf-G*
-- 		g G	The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
-- 			value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
-- 			(exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
-- 			for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
-- 			zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
-- 			immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
-- 			results in 1.0e7.
--
-- 							*printf-%*
-- 		%	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
-- 			complete conversion specification is "%%".
--
-- 		When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
-- 		accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
-- 		is also accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		Any other argument type results in an error message.
--
-- 							*E766* *E767*
-- 		The number of {exprN} arguments must exactly match the number
-- 		of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
-- 		arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.

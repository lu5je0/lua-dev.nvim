-- 		See |channel-bytes| for more information.
--
-- 		{data} may be a string, string convertible, or a list.  If
-- 		{data} is a list, the items will be joined by newlines; any

--
-- 		chansend() writes raw data, not RPC messages.  If the channel

--
-- 		"starting" is to be used when a test should behave like

-- 		When {dragging} is non-zero it's like dragging the scrollbar,

--
-- 		The returned list contains two entries: a list with the change
-- 		locations and the current position in the list.  Each
-- 		entry in the change list is a dictionary with the following
-- 		entries:
-- 			col		column number
-- 			coladd		column offset for 'virtualedit'
-- 			lnum		line number
-- 		If buffer {expr} is the current buffer, then the current

-- 			32	mouse double click
-- 			64	mouse triple click
-- 			96	mouse quadruple click (== 32 + 64)
-- 			128	command (Macintosh only)
-- 		Only the modifiers that have not been included in the

-- Return the current character search information as a {dict}

-- 				if no character search has been performed
-- 		    forward	direction of character search; 1 for forward,
-- 				0 for backward
-- 		    until	type of character search; 1 for a |t| or |T|
-- 				character search, 0 for an |f| or |F|
-- 				character search

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they
-- 		come from a mapping or were typed by the user.
--
-- 		By default the string is added to the end of the typeahead
-- 		buffer, thus if a mapping is still being executed the
-- 		characters come after them.  Use the 'i' flag to insert before
-- 		other characters, they will be executed next, before any
-- 		characters from a mapping.
--
-- 		The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in
-- 		{string}.
--
-- 		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes
-- 		and "\..." notation |expr-quote|. For example,
-- 		feedkeys("\<CR>") simulates pressing of the <Enter> key. But
-- 		feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
-- 		The |<Ignore>| keycode may be used to exit the
-- 		wait-for-character without doing anything.
--
-- 		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.  If {mode} is absent,
-- 			keys are remapped.
-- 		'n'	Do not remap keys.
-- 		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
-- 			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
-- 			opening folds, etc.
-- 		'i'	Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
-- 		'x'	Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
-- 			similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
-- 			several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
-- 			(possibly with an empty {string}) to execute all the
-- 			typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
-- 			will behave as if <Esc> is typed, to avoid getting
-- 			stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
-- 			script continues.
-- 			Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
-- 			executing commands, thus calling it recursively, the
-- 			all typehead will be consumed by the last call.
-- 		'!'	When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be
-- 			used in a test when a timer is set to exit Insert mode
-- 			a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.
--
-- 		Return value is always 0.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.feedkeys(string, mode) end

-- Move the window {nr} to a new split of the window {target}.
-- 		This is similar to moving to {target}, creating a new window
-- 		using |:split| but having the same contents as window {nr}, and
-- 		then closing {nr}.
--
-- 		Both {nr} and {target} can be window numbers or |window-ID|s.
--
-- 		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
--
-- 		{options} is a Dictionary with the following optional entries:
-- 		  "vertical"	When TRUE, the split is created vertically,
-- 				like with |:vsplit|.
-- 		  "rightbelow"	When TRUE, the split is made below or to the
-- 				right (if vertical).  When FALSE, it is done
-- 				above or to the left (if vertical).  When not
-- 				present, the values of 'splitbelow' and
-- 				'splitright' are used.

-- Get a single character from the user or input stream.
-- 		If [expr] is omitted, wait until a character is available.
-- 		If [expr] is 0, only get a character when one is available.
-- 			Return zero otherwise.
-- 		If [expr] is 1, only check if a character is available, it is
-- 			not consumed.  Return zero if no character available.
--
-- 		Without [expr] and when [expr] is 0 a whole character or
-- 		special key is returned.  If it is a single character, the
-- 		result is a number.  Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
-- 		Otherwise a String is returned with the encoded character.
-- 		For a special key it's a String with a sequence of bytes
-- 		starting with 0x80 (decimal: 128).  This is the same value as
-- 		the String "\<Key>", e.g., "\<Left>".  The returned value is
-- 		also a String when a modifier (shift, control, alt) was used
-- 		that is not included in the character.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay
-- 		while Vim waits to see if this is the start of an escape
-- 		sequence.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 1 only the first byte is returned.  For a
-- 		one-byte character it is the character itself as a number.
-- 		Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
--
-- 		Use getcharmod() to obtain any additional modifiers.
--
-- 		When the user clicks a mouse button, the mouse event will be
-- 		returned.  The position can then be found in |v:mouse_col|,
-- 		|v:mouse_lnum|, |v:mouse_winid| and |v:mouse_win|.  This
-- 		example positions the mouse as it would normally happen: >
-- 			let c = getchar()
-- 			if c == "\<LeftMouse>" && v:mouse_win > 0
-- 			  exe v:mouse_win . "wincmd w"
-- 			  exe v:mouse_lnum
-- 			  exe "normal " . v:mouse_col . "|"
-- 			endif
-- <
-- 		There is no prompt, you will somehow have to make clear to the
-- 		user that a character has to be typed.
-- 		There is no mapping for the character.
-- 		Key codes are replaced, thus when the user presses the <Del>
-- 		key you get the code for the <Del> key, not the raw character
-- 		sequence.  Examples: >
-- 			getchar() == "\<Del>"
-- 			getchar() == "\<S-Left>"
-- <		This example redefines "f" to ignore case: >
-- 			:nmap f :call FindChar()<CR>
-- 			:function FindChar()
-- 			:  let c = nr2char(getchar())
-- 			:  while col('.') < col('$') - 1
-- 			:    normal l

-- 		    {initdir}	directory to start browsing in

-- Read file {fname} and return a |List|, each line of the file
-- 		as an item.  Lines are broken at NL characters.  Macintosh
-- 		files separated with CR will result in a single long line
-- 		(unless a NL appears somewhere).
-- 		All NUL characters are replaced with a NL character.
-- 		When {binary} contains "b" binary mode is used:
-- 		- When the last line ends in a NL an extra empty list item is
-- 		  added.
-- 		- No CR characters are removed.
-- 		Otherwise:
-- 		- CR characters that appear before a NL are removed.
-- 		- Whether the last line ends in a NL or not does not matter.
-- 		- Any UTF-8 byte order mark is removed from the text.
-- 		When {max} is given this specifies the maximum number of lines
-- 		to be read.  Useful if you only want to check the first ten
-- 		lines of a file: >
-- 			:for line in readfile(fname, '', 10)
-- 			:  if line =~ 'Date' | echo line | endif
-- 			:endfor
-- <		When {max} is negative -{max} lines from the end of the file
-- 		are returned, or as many as there are.
-- 		When {max} is zero the result is an empty list.
-- 		Note that without {max} the whole file is read into memory.
-- 		Also note that there is no recognition of encoding.  Read a
-- 		file into a buffer if you need to.
-- 		When the file can't be opened an error message is given and
-- 		the result is an empty list.
-- 		Also see |writefile()|.
